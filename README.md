# Keylogger-Plus
Keylogger-Plus is a local keylogger.
Functional login and registration using SQLite3 database, so I won't see any of your stuff and it is local on your computer.
Logs your keyboard inputs anywhere and stores them in a structural manner in the database.
Almost finished! Just need to combine Tkinter and the Logger class because Tkinter has a blocking thread, then perform data analysis on the database should be no issue because it is orderly!
